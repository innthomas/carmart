Frontend Devs. here is your task
Using bootstrap, create a 
gallery page for either dogs, cars, books, bags, or anything that you love.
Your gallery should have 
an image,  
a name, and 
a price for each item.
Note: you are to create an array of objects for 
12 items and use either a 
foreach or a for loop to display them on your page. Whatever is displayed on your page should come from your array.
Ensure your page is responsive. Also, create a 
hero page or landing page for whatever you have in mind to put on your gallery. So you should have a landing page and a gallery page.
It's should also be beautiful. Limit your use of CSS and use more bootstrap classes
